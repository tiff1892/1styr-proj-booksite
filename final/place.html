<h2>Secondhand Bookstores</h2>
<ul><li><h3><strong>Chapter IX Books</strong></h3></li>
	<article>Upon stumbling on Chapter IX, you'd be surprised how well-curated their stocks are. Gary Montenegro, the owner, insists on selling books
that he likes and he'd want to share with his customers. Everything is a good find and reasonably priced, too. Unless you want to bring home the
whole store, browse their shelves through their Facebook page before dropping by to make a shopping list.</article>
	<li><h3><strong>Booksale</strong></h3></li>
	<article>Every visit to a Booksale store is a rewarding experience that enables you to savor the joy of browsing through the myriad book assortment,
which is changed and replenished regularly in our 91 stores.</article>
	<li><h3><strong>Bookay-ukay Libruhan II</strong></h3></li>
	<article>Bookay-ukay has been a part of the "book scene" hosting events and joining bazaars for a couple of years. It is a staple of Maginhawa&#8217;s diverse
culture and actually one of the establishments sought after in Teachers&#8217; Village.</article>
	<li><h3><strong>Books from Underground</strong></h3></li>
	<article>A bookstore is not something you&#8217;d expect while in transit in the middle of Manila City Hall&#8217;s Underpass. Books from Underground is stocked
floor-to-ceiling with obscure fictions, textbooks, and coffee table books, among others. You name it, the shop has it or had it at one
point (if not, the owner is happy to find for you).</article>
	<li><h3><strong>Books For Less</strong></h3></li>
	<article>While the store branches are carefully sorted out, their warehouse sale is a different matter. It is both a dream and a nightmare: P10 for
 all the books? Make sure you bring an eco-bag...or a box (maybe two?). Their stores are usually well-curated and everything is helpfully labelled,
but their selection doesn&#8217;t go beyond best-sellers. It&#8217;s a good place to duck in once in a while, if you have time to spare, and you might see a rogue
title if you&#8217;re lucky.</article>

	<h4><article>Of course, there are still so many other bookstores which are not listed above. You can even order pre-loved books online.
And sometimes, <strong><a href="gallery.html">Big Bad Wolf Books</strong></a> (The Big Bad Wolf Book Sale or BBW Books), a Malaysian book fair frequently held in Malaysia,
Thailand Indonesia and Sri Lanka, sometimes come here in the Philippines to sell a variety of very affordable books.
 The books were majorly taken from the stocks of BookXcess, a book store dealing in excess or remaindered books from international distributors.
The Sale was the brainchild of BookXcess founders Andrew Yap and Jacqueline Ng.</article></h4>
