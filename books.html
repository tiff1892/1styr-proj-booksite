	<h2>Different Types of Books</h2>
	<ul id="books">
		<li><strong>NON-FICTION</strong></li>
		<p>Non-fiction is a type of literature that gives information or describes real events, rather than telling a story. Biographies are examples of non-fiction works. Other examples of non-fiction books are the "how to" books and travel books.</p>
		<li><strong>FICTION</strong></li>
		<p>Fiction is the type of book or story that is written about imaginary characters and events and not based on real people and facts. It can also refer, more narrowly, to narratives written only in prose (the novel and short story), and is often used as a synonym for the novel.</p>
	<article>The two types of books can be further divided into many different sub-types, called <a href="genre.html">"genres."</a> Some of the books 
under those genres are even turned into <a href="books2.html">movies</a>. Others might not have been
 adapted into a movie or a TV series, but, they still captured the hearts of the readers. The <a href="best.html">best&#8211;selling novels</a> of all time by
 very talented <a href="auth.html">authors</a> keep the readers on the edge of their seats, wanting to finish the book, but 
also do not want the book to finish.</article>
