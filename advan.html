<center><h2><article>Why Read?</article></h2></center>

<article>
	For bookworms, one of their greatest achievements would be to make their one or more of their friends or loved ones do the 
things they want to do &#8212; reading. But how do you encourage people to read, especially the younger generations, when there are so many distractions in this
modern time? Well, here are some of the benefits that might encourage them to read regularly:
</article>
	
<ol><li><h2>It Increases Intelligence</h2></li>
	<article>Reading not only helps you retain information, but it also helps you maintain that knowledge through old age. As <strong>Dr. Seuss</strong>
 once wrote, &#8220;The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you&#8217;ll go.&#8221; 
Reading opens up a whole world of knowledge starting from a very young age. Everything you read fills your head with new bits of information.</article>
	<li><h2>It Improves Your Memory</h2></li>
	<article>The brain&#8211;stimulating activities from reading have shown to slow down cognitive decline in old age with people who participated in more
 mentally stimulating activities over their lifetimes. It also has shown a slower rate of decline in memory and other mental capacities.</article>
	<li><h2>It Stimulates Your Mind</h2></li>
	<article>Your brain on books is an amazing thing. Did you know that studies show that those who read test better on exams? There are also some who say 
that readers lead more fulling lives. Books are also known to stimulate creativity. When we read, we trigger parts of our brain to be imaginative. 
We can &#8220;see&#8221; the scenes and people in our mind&#8217;s eye. The theater of the mind can be a powerful place. Stimulating it can help us solve problems
 in other areas of our lives.</article>
	<li><h2>It Helps You Relax</h2></li>
	<article>Reading is the best way to relax and even six minutes can be enough to reduce the stress levels by more than two thirds, according to new research. 
And it works better and faster than other methods to calm frazzled nerves such as listening to music, going for a walk or settling down with a cup of tea, 
research found.</article>
	<li><h2>It Expands Your Vocabulary</h2></li>
	<article>The more books you crack open, the more words you'll be exposed to. Those words will eventually find a place in your own vocabulary. 
Exposure to new vocabularies not only leads to higher score on reading tests, but also higher scores on general tests of intelligence.</article>
	<li><h2>It Can Help Prevent Alzheimer's</h2></li>
	<article>A study in the <strong>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</strong>, found that older people who read regularly are two and a half times 
less likely to have Alzheimer's. While that doesn't mean reading alone will prevent Alzheimer's, it does suggest that there's a correlation between
 intellectual pursuits, like reading, and prevention.</article>
	<li><h2>It Helps Boost Your Analytical Thinking</h2></li>
	<article> The more you read, the better you're able to spot patterns, which helps to build those analytical thinking skills.
 <strong>Cunningham&#8217;s </strong>studies 
have found that analytical thinking is boosted by reading. Readers improve their general knowledge, and more importantly are able to spot patterns quicker. 
If you can spot patterns quicker, your analytical skills receive a boost.</article>
	<li><h2>It Makes You Empathethic</h2></li>
	<article>Reading makes it easier for you to relate to others. Literary fiction, especifically, has the power to to help its readers understand what 
others are thinking by reading other people's emotions, according to a research published in <strong>Science</strong>.</article>
